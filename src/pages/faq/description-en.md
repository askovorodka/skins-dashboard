#### Functional elements

In the upper right corner of the site there are buttons to change the language:

- RU - Russian, EN - English, CN - Chinese.

- To the right of the language buttons is the Steam status indicator. Green means it is working perfectly, blue means it is working with delays, and red indicates that the Steam servers are unavailable.

- To the right of the buttons indicating the Steam status there is a button to exit your personal account.

- The second line contains the name of the account holder and his or her reference number in the Skins4Real system.

- On the right side of the second line is your current account balance and the withdraw funds button. When you click on the withdraw funds button, a window opens where you can select one of three payment systems, specify your e-wallet number and the payment amount. Also pay attention to the field for adding notes: since all withdrawals are done manually, you can leave a note for the employee who will withdraw the funds. When you click on the "Make a withdrawal" button, you send your withdrawal request. Also, on the left side of the window there is a "Payment history" button, where you can view your transaction history including all withdrawals from the site.

- In the third row of the home page there are "Statistics", "Transactions", "Charts" and "Reports" buttons, and to the right of these buttons there is a tool for selecting the time period for generating a report. When you click the button with the date selection, you can select the start and end date of the report. You can also select transactions for the calendar month, week, year, as well as today's transactions.

- The statistics tab displays the payment history for the selected time period. You can switch between CS: GO and DOTA payments or view them all at once. Custom actions show the success of the transactions. Note that the statistics are displayed in two rows, with the top row displaying rouble deposit statistics, and the bottom row displaying dollar deposit statistics.

- The transaction tab displays the list of payments for the selected time period. You can search by transaction number, which is displayed in the payment history on your website to which Skins4Real is connected, and you can also filter by transaction cost and number of items. In the centre of the screen a list of all the transactions performed on the site is displayed. To the left of each transaction is a light corresponding to its status: green - transaction complete, yellow - transaction not confirmed by user, red - transaction cancelled by user.

- The graphics tab gives a visual representation of the information from the previous tabs. By clicking on the "Income", "Average basket size" and "Unique users" buttons, you can turn these lines on and off on the chart. Under the chart are buttons for grouping transactions by hour, day, month and year. In the upper right corner of the chart there is a button for switching currencies (note that payments are shown separately for roubles and for dollars).

- The reports tab enables you to generate a report for all transactions for the selected period and export it in .csv and .xlsx formats. These detailed reports give all the available information on every transaction for the chosen time period.

- The support center button at the very bottom of the screen opens this page. In the left side menu you can also get support contact information.
